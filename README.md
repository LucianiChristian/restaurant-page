# Learning Outcomes
<h3>Project Handling</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : Structuring my project with NPM and Webpack was a valuable exploration. I have only scratched the surface of what can be done here.</li>
  <li>Insight : There is no reason I should ever design and code the webpage in parallel. Rather I should always be coding from a design, otherwise the page structure and appearance will always suffer from an unestablished foundation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Practice : Working with NPM and Webpack gave me opportunities to work a bit more from the command line as well as with a new set of tools. These included importing assets (css, images, fonts), breaking the page into modules or components, and utilizing source mapping to retain the ability to track errors through a bundled file.</li>
  <li>Practice : Using custom proprties in CSS, although a relatively straightforward addition, gave me a ton of satisfaction. 
  </li>
  <li>Insight : I have gotten a glimpse of how open a web application is to augmentation through packages and tooling. It will be interesting to see how far this goes in the next few months.</li>
</ul>
